POC Application on how Surfly can be integrated

To install:
  - set the correct USERNAME/PASSWORD for both Surfly and Opentok in mayday.py
  - Specify the proxy end point and the continuation point in surfly.js
  - Include the widget (static/surfly.js) somewhere on your page, ie use: 
      ```<script src="/surfly.js" type="text/javascript"></script>```

The proxy point is part of the mayday.py script.      
For the session continuation script take a look at: https://github.com/surfly/continuation
